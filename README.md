# Color Game

A fun and interactive color guessing game built with React.

## Description

In this game, the player is presented with a target color and multiple color options. The player must guess the correct color from the options. The game keeps track of the player's score, providing feedback whether the guess is correct or incorrect. Upon a correct guess, the player earns a point, and a new game starts. 

## Features

- **Random Color Generation**: Each round generates a new target color.
- **Multiple Options**: 6 color options are displayed, one of which matches the target color.
- **Scoring**: The score increases by 1 for each correct guess.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Subtle visual effects to enhance gameplay.
